  ]
  [cmd include; file[;] *(name[;] value);

  ]
  [cmd p; text;
    Creates a paragraph with the given [param text].
  ]
  [cmd pass; code;
    Directly produces the given [param code] without escaping it. Useful if you want to go outside the capabilities of xidoc. The [param code] is still expanded so you can parametrize it, see the [cmd-ref pass-raw] command if you don't want this.
  ]
  [cmd pass-raw; code;
    Directly produces the given [param code] without escaping it. Useful if you want to go outside the capabilities of xidoc. Works as a combination of [cmd-ref pass] and [cmd-ref raw].
  ]
  [cmd proof; ?name[;] text;
    Renders a mathematical proof paragraph with an optional [param name].
  ]
  [cmd props; *properties;
    Creates a list of mathematical [param properties].
  ]
  [cmd raw; text;
    Returns the given [param text] without expanding it.
  ]
  [cmd section; ?title[;] text;
    Creates a section with the given [param title] and [param text] (or without a title if not given). If it's inside another section, it will be a subsection. If it's inside a subsection, it will be a subsubsection. In HTML, this nesting can continue further.
  ]
  [cmd set-doc-lang; language;
    Sets the global [param language] of the document. Returns nothing.
  ]
  [cmd set-math-renderer; renderer;
    Determines how [LaTeX] math will be rendered in HTML. The options are:

[section CSS commands;
  [p xidoc includes a simple set of commands that can be used to generate CSS without having to embed a completely different syntax in your document. It can be included using the [cmd-ref style] command. (If you prefer normal CSS, use [ms [raw [add-to-head [<style> …]]]].)]
  [cmd :; property[;] value;
    Creates a CSS declaration: [ms property: value;].
  ]
  [cmd rule; selector[;] declarations;
    Creates a CSS rule: [ms selector { declarations }].
  ]
  [cmd var; name[;] ?value;
    If a [param value] is given, declares a CSS variable: [ms --name: value;]. If used outside a [cmd-ref rule], it's assigned to [ms :root]. If used without a [param value], it gets the value of the given variable: [ms var(--name)].
  ]
]
[section Math commands;
  [p These commands are available in [LaTeX] math. That is, inside the [cmd-ref $], [cmd-ref $$] and [cmd-ref $$&] commands. They are meant to make certain common combinations of [LaTeX] commands easier to type.]
