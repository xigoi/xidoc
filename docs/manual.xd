[section Syntax;
  [p The only special characters in xidoc are square brackets, semicolons and whitespace. Everything except these characters is treated as literal text.]
  [p [it Commands] are the basic building block of xidoc. Every command invocation is enclosed in square brackets. The first sequence of non-whitespace characters inside the brackets is treated as the command name[;] the remaining text is given to the command. Most commands ignore the leading whitespace. Many commands can take multiple arguments, in which case they split the text on semicolons[;] whitespace around the semicolons is ignored. If the text contains more square brackets, they may or may not be treated as a command invocation (depending on the surrounding command), but they should always be balanced.]
  [p Multiple whitespace in a row is changed into a single space in the output, which allows you to indent your code as you want without affecting the generated code.]
