## I'm Using GitHub Under Protest

This project is currently hosted on GitHub. This is not ideal; GitHub is a proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). I am deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub to develop my FOSS project. I urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you want to contribute to this project, please consider doing so on [SourceHut](https://sr.ht/~xigoi/xidoc/) instead.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done without my permission. I do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's code in Copilot.
